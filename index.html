            <p class="description"> This was a design of my band's logo that I had designed, fully done inside of Procreate. I had used the Forester airbrush and Stanley to create this.</p>

            <p class="description"> This was a canvas painting I created to try to recreate the iconic album cover of Tame Impala's Currents, featuring songs like "The Less I Know The Better" and "New Person, Same Old Mistakes." I used tempura paint and a 6 by 8 inch canvas. I used "flow" art to make the background, and painted over it with the rest after letting it dry a day. </p>

            <p class="description">This I had drawn the day of the album being announced, it is a recreation of the album cover from Little Image's Kill the Ghost. There is a speed draw of it on my YouTube channel <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/YY368Zwn8IM?si=UxQf4Y--vZ-ywBf_">here</a>. I drew this in procreate using 2 brush packs from Devin Elle Kurtz on Gumroad.</p>

            <p class="description"> Around when the tariffs had been put out in early to mid 2025, I had seen that they put tariffs on an island only inhabited by penguins, namely the Heard and McDonald Islands. I had done this inside of <a href="kleki.com">kleki.com</a>, on a laptop as well. It was modeled after a picture of penguins right in front of a masive hill of ice, and hasa the Southern Cross in the top left. The colors are the colors of penguins, which are the only large population of animals (along with seals).</p>
